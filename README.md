# Post Rock Album Name Generator

Creates cosmic sounding album names for your post rock album. Unfortunately
this doesn't yet capture the trope of album names with first/second-person
components (e.g., *Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven*,
*Take Care, Take Care, Take Care*).

I should probably add more words to the dictionary and probably put this
up in a simple website instead of a Python script. But it works and it's
really just an excuse for me to mess with `functools`!
